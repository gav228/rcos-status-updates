## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Familiarized myself with the written code. Identified recreatable bugs, began looking for solutions and potential modifications to snapping logic

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to check our new grid based snapping logic and try to identify the bug in our check cube.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm still getting used to the code but it's starting to feel familiar

## Notes

> Should be fun to work on
