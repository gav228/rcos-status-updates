## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Added a class related to viewing the grid when moving cubes. Cube snapping looks good, there is still a bug with the check cube.

## This Week's Plan

> Finish viewable grid. Start on preventing two cubes in the same spot.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm not sure how our program is using tkinter to draw the application. Confused about canvas hierarchy

## Notes

> Think about overall hierarchy and potential simplifications/improvements. Several files have many classes within them.
